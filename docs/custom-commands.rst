Custom commands
===============

This document will cover how to send and handle IRC commands that don't have
dedicated methods or event handlers.

Sending
-------

To send custom IRC commands, use :meth:`IRCBot.send_raw`. For example, to send
an ``INVITE`` command, you would call::

    mybot.send_raw("INVITE", ["<nickname>", "<channel>"])

You may find it useful to create methods for custom commands;
for example::

    class MyBot(IRCBot):
        def invite(self, nickname, channel):
            self.send_raw("INVITE", [nickname, channel])

Handling
--------

To handle custom IRC commands, define the event in your bot class and then call
:meth:`IRCBot.register_event` in your ``__init__`` method. To handle ``INVITE``
messages, for example, you would write something like this::

    class MyBot(IRCBot):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.register_event(self.on_invite, "INVITE")

        def on_invite(self, nickname, target, channel):
            # In custom event handlers, only the first parameter is
            # case-insensitive. Other parameters must be manually
            # converted.
            channel, target = IStr(channel), IStr(target)
            print(nickname, "has invited", target, "to", channel)

As stated in the example above, in custom event handlers, only the first
parameter (usually the nickname of the user the command originated from) is
case-insensitive. All other parameters that represent nicknames or channels
must be manually converted to `IStr`. See :meth:`IRCBot.register_event` for
more information.

Numeric replies are handled in the same way as regular commands, although it
may be more appropriate to name the first parameter ``server`` instead of
``nickname``. Also remember that the first argument of numeric replies (besides
``server``) is the target of the reply (your bot).
